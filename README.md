## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Installation instructions
Only requires Python. 

## Usage
To play the game, download and run milestone_5.py
```
python milestone_5.py
```

## Future work

Right now, the number of lives or the list of words is hard coded. I think it would be nice to allow the user to change these values so I could add that function through CLI(command line interface).
